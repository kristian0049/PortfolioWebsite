# PortfolioWebsite
## Hello , my name is Kristian Kirkov and this is my Portfolio website.

### Programming Languages used:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

### Web Design Choices:
- For the style of the website , I used Neumorphism which was recommended by a friend. After looking through the Web (going through 2-3 links), I arrived at this article https://www.svgator.com/blog/neumorphism-origin-influence-design/ , where an in-depth explanation is given and links with CSS guides that explains how the style is created.
- At the beginning I chose 4 colors which looked pretty ugly. The same friend which recommended the style also told me to use at least 2 to 3 colors. I ended up using this website https://hype4.academy/tools/neumorphism-generator to pick my color. The colors I ended up with were :
  - ![#6D5083](https://placehold.co/15x15/f03c15/f03c15.png) `#6D5083` for background
  - ![#513b61](https://placehold.co/15x15/f03c15/f03c15.png) `#513b61` for primary
  - ![#8965a5](https://placehold.co/15x15/f03c15/f03c15.png) `#8965a5` for secondary

### I have not finished the Projects Page yet , which I plan to create and publish in the future.
